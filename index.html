                Hi, I am Rubina Dulal—though you can call me Rubss! I am a passionate Computer Science major, complementing my technical pursuits with a minor in Film Studies. 
                My journey as an international student brought me to the USA, driven by my thirst for a world-class education and a desire to immerse myself in diverse learning experiences.
                My enthusiasm for becoming a full-stack developer grows stronger each day. What started as a newfound interest in coding has blossomed into a genuine passion. While I’m still honing my skills, I embrace every challenge with determination and an eagerness to improve. My current focus lies in web development, where I’m exploring how to create seamless, user-friendly digital experiences.
                Beyond my academic and professional interests, I have a deep love for nature and an unbreakable bond with animals, especially dogs and cats. When I’m not coding, you can find me immersing myself in creativity—playing with colors, sketching, and pouring my thoughts into my journal. This blend of logic and artistry fuels my unique approach to problem-solving and design.
                I am excited about the future and eager to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of technology and creativity. Let’s build something amazing together!
